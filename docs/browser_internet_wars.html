                    Between 1994 and 1997 was an era of the internet that caused a huge uproar in the internet world. This period of time would come to be known as the Browser Wars, in which two companies would face off against each other to dominate the world wide web, and only one of them could be the one standing on top of it all. This all started with Bill Gates and his colleague, Paul Allen, who together would create Microsoft. Gates’ dream was to have every single household in the world have a computer that was running Microsoft software. By 1993, Gates’ dream was almost achieved as about 90% of the world’s computers were running on Microsoft Windows which would make Microsoft billions of dollars. It was due to this massive success that the creators of the original browser, Mosaic, back in 1993 would be compelled to create the competing browser, Netscape Navigator. The creators of Netscape knew that they had to take down Microsoft as it was their competition in this market, but Microsoft was already the tech giant in the industry. Netscape would quickly become very popular and Microsoft had to take notice of their new competitor and attempt to overcome them. The benefit that Microsoft had was that the top talent worked there, and they had greater financial backing. Microsoft did in fact copy every move that Netscape would make with their browser and quickly copy it, releasing new versions of Internet Explorer rapidly. Then Microsoft would put the final nail in the coffin by making their browser completely free and seamlessly installed with every Windows computer. Netscape did not have the option to become a free browser and in turn would lose the browser war in September 1997, where Internet Explorer would be used by 80% of browser users. Microsoft would go on to be sued and found guilty of trying to maintain a monopoly over the industry which almost cause the company to break apart, but an appeal was made, and Microsoft was able to stay afloat. Gates would step down as CEO and Microsoft would continue to be a goliath in the industry.

                        Traversing the internet was no simple task in the early years of its public use. That was the case until the first internet search engine was created, Yahoo. Yahoo was in extremely early stages of being a true search engine like those that exist today. The founders of Yahoo would have to manually search the internet and categorize various websites they came across so that a user who visited Yahoo can follow through a category to find a website that matches their interest. It was not a perfect system and obviously had many flaws, but this was only the beginning of search engines on the internet. Even with how simple the site was, millions of users found their way to Yahoo and used it every day. At this point no company had ever really figured out how to make money on the internet, but the idea to advertise to users was introduced. Yahoo was reluctant to implement advertisements on their website in fear of alienating its user base. However, after placing banner ads on the site and bracing themselves for the worst outcome, Yahoo just became more and more popular, proving that a company can indeed make profit on the internet. A competitor to Yahoo was also founded called Excite. It was a similar search engine to Yahoo and it caused both companies to copy each other’s every move to make sure neither had the upper hand. Because of this feud between the sites, it seemed that the companies forgot their purpose in the first place, which was being a search engine first and foremost. Thus, Google was created to become the best search engine on the internet. Google became the fastest growing company ever and is still the top search engine today.
