                    Many important people have impacted our lives when it comes to using the internet in todayâ€™s date. Kevin Rose, Founder and Chief architect of Digg, was able to produce a website that aimed to select stories specifically for the internet audience such as science, trending political issues and viral internet issues. This gave the power to the people to vote and decide what was shown and important to see in the front page. Chad Hurley was the Co-Founder and former CEO of the video-sharing website known as Youtube. Thanks to this individual, sharing videos and giving the power to the people to post whatever they wanted to make it popular among peers was easy to use. This changed the online video entertainment industry since anyone could pickup a camera and just film themselves to do whatever they wanted to and post it on their website. Mark Zuckerberb, Founder and CEO of Facebook, managed to bring people together in an online social gathering to share your pictures, status and other interests with anyone without having to know them in person or be near them by any means. This gave the people the chance to interact with family members as well as friends and strangers.

                        The W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium, an international community that works together to develop standards for the world wide web. The W3C intends to ensure the progression and development of the internet by creating protocols to improve the internet. As these protocols are created, software and hardware producers follow the protocols to make sure that their products will operate successfully with the newest technologies. The W3C provides guidelines for browsers to follow as well so that websites will work the same across all different types of browsers. There are guidelines for types of data on the internet as well like audio and video, and as long as companies and web pages all adhere to the protocols, users interacting with the internet in different ways can all find and experience the same exact information. The W3C also provides guidelines for HTML and CSS, which are used in web pages. HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is used to create the structure of a web page. Elements of HTML describe the different pieces of the web page from the header of the page to the text inside. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, on the other hand is used to add style to a web page. CSS changes how something may look on a web page, such as the colors of the page or text. CSS and HTML are separate, but work together to create web pages. Essentially, HTML gives foundation and the layout to a web page, and CSS creates the style for the web page and designs it.
